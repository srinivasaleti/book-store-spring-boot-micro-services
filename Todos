Microservices Roadmap 🚀
1️⃣ Core Concepts
✅ Learn Microservices Architecture
✅ Understand Monolith vs Microservices
✅ Read Building Microservices - Sam Newman

2️⃣ Basic Service Setup
❌ Create Catalog Service (Product Listings)
❌ Create Order Service (Order Processing)
❌ Create Notification Service (Email/SMS Updates)
❌ Create Payment Service (Transaction Handling)
❌ Create UI Application (Frontend)

3️⃣ Communication Between Services
❌ Use REST / gRPC (Sync)
❌ Implement Kafka / RabbitMQ (Async)

4️⃣ API Gateway & Security
❌ Set up Spring Cloud Gateway
❌ Implement JWT Authentication
❌ Apply Rate Limiting (Resilience4j)

5️⃣ Database & Caching
❌ Use PostgreSQL / MongoDB
❌ Implement Redis / Memcached for caching

6️⃣ Observability & Monitoring
❌ Add Spring Boot Actuator
❌ Set up Distributed Tracing (Zipkin/Jaeger)
❌ Implement Centralized Logging (ELK / Loki + Grafana)

7️⃣ Distributed Transactions & CQRS
❌ Implement SAGA Pattern
❌ Use Event Sourcing for Order Service

8️⃣ Scaling & Deployment
❌ Deploy with Docker & Kubernetes
❌ Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions / ArgoCD

9️⃣ Fault Tolerance & Resilience
❌ Implement Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j / Hystrix)
❌ Add Retry & Bulkhead Patterns (Resilience4j)
❌ Enable Graceful Shutdown & Fallback Strategies

1️⃣0️⃣ Message-Driven Architecture
❌ Deep dive into Event-Driven Architecture
❌ Use Kafka / RabbitMQ for async communication
❌ Implement Event Choreography vs Orchestration

🔥 Advanced Topics (Optional but Valuable)
❌ Service Mesh – Use Istio or Linkerd for traffic management & security
❌ GraphQL vs REST – Explore GraphQL for optimized data fetching
❌ Multi-Tenancy – Design services for handling multiple clients
❌ Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – Learn Terraform or Pulumi for cloud provisioning
❌ Serverless Microservices – Use AWS Lambda / Azure Functions for lightweight services
❌ Sidecar Pattern – Implement proxies for enhanced observability & security
❌ Chaos Engineering – Inject failures with tools like Gremlin / Chaos Monkey
